# Zelula - Programming life contextproject TU Delft, 2012 (group E)

The aim of Zelula (also referred to with `synthbio`) is to develop a graphical modeling and simulation package for synthetic genetic networks. 
The networks are represented as logical circuits where proteins can be assigned as signal carriers. The DNA of the created circuits can be exported 
in the industry standard SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) format.
