\section{Introduction}
In this report the different testing techniques we will use for this project will be explained. Because our solution has a clear division between server and client and because these will be developed in different programming environments, we will also need different testing strategies. In chapter 1 a prioritization of the requirements can be found using the MoSCoW system. BLA BLA BLA. Lastly chapter 4 will cover the risk analysis, describing the risks for the successful implementation of the system.

\section{MoSCoW prioritization}
% (prioritization of requirements: Must, Should, Could, Wont)
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Requirement & MoSCoW\\[2mm] \hline
Circuit Abstraction & Must \\
Protein specification & Must \\
Available proteins & Must \\
Export XML & Must \\
Interfering sigals & Must \\
Invalid signals & Should \\
Re-use BioBricks & Should \\
Multi-client & Could \\
Local back-up & Could \\
Import XML & Wont \\
Biological plausibility & Wont \\
