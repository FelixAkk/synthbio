\section{Introduction}
In this SCRUM plan we define the tasks we want to complete in this sprint. Every task is assigned to one or two developers and an estimate is provided for the effort required.

For each SCRUM run a milestone is created at GitHub, with issues for the tasks selected. The issues for this milestone can be found on: \githubmilestone{10}.

\section{Selection and assignment of tasks}
This is the third sprint of our project. During this sprint we will implement validation, evaluation and simulation of a circuit. We will also look at saving and loading a circuit. If all goes according to plan we can start reusing previously build circuits and simulate the outcome of a circuit. If we do this it means we have the product we planned implementing at the beginning of this project. Afterwards it will only be fine tuning.

\paragraph{Available time}
The time available is four mornings in two weeks by five people. That's about sixteen hours per person.Including meetings we come to an estimate of 70 hours of actual working. However, this is below the amount of hours spend with respect to ECTS, so we will plan spend a little more.

A list of tasks, assignments and effort estimations is included in a table.
