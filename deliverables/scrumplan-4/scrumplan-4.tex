\section{Introduction}
In this SCRUM plan we define the tasks we want to complete in this sprint. Every task is assigned to one or two developers and an estimate is provided for the effort required.

For each SCRUM run a milestone is created at GitHub, with issues for the tasks selected. The issues for this milestone can be found on: \githubmilestone{11}.

\section{Selection and assignment of tasks}
This is the fourth sprint of our project. 

\paragraph{Available time}
The time available is five  mornings in two weeks by five people. That's about twenty hours per person.Including meetings we come to an estimate of 90 hours of actual working. 

A list of tasks, assignments and effort estimations is included in a table.
