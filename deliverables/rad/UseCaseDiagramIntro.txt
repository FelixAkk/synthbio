In this usecase diagram you can see all the different option available for our user. 
Inbetween starting and closing the application, the user can model BioBricks. 
Once these BioBricks are modeled they can be exported to SBML. 
These SBML files can be imported again and used to create more complex BioBricks. 
During the modeling, the user can specify which proteins will be used as input.
Once the BioBricks have been modeled, their output can be simulated.
We will describe some example scenario's to further explain this diagram.
