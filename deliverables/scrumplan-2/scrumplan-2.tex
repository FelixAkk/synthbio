\section{Introduction}
In this SCRUM plan we define the tasks we want to complete in this sprint. Every task is assigned to one or two developers and an estimate is provided for the effort required.

For each SCRUM run a milestone is created at GitHub, with issues for the tasks selected. The issues for this milestone can be found on: \githubmilestone{9}.

\section{Selection and assignment of tasks}
Because this is the first iteration, it is hard to predict how things work out. Lots of things are to be sorted out and we have to become familiar with the tools to be used.

\paragraph{Available time}
The time available is five mornings in two weeks by five people. That's about twenty hours per person, however, some time should be reserved for the meetings. So the total effort available is about 90 man hours.

A list of tasks, assignments and effort estimations is included in a table.


\paragraph{Presentation}
Results for this iteration will be presented thursday may 4, 12:15 in DW-PC 0.010.
