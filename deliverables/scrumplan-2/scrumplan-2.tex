\section{Introduction}
In this SCRUM plan we define the tasks we want to complete in this sprint. Every task is assigned to one or two developers and an estimate is provided for the effort required.

For each SCRUM run a milestone is created at GitHub, with issues for the tasks selected. The issues for this milestone can be found on: \githubmilestone{9}.

\section{Selection and assignment of tasks}
Because this is the second iteration, we think we will find less unexpected tasks. The available time is more than last time, so we want to do more work than in the last iteration. For this iteration, the goal is to end up with a GUI that supports basic circuit design and a back-end that supports basic circuit handling (loading/saving/validating).

\paragraph{Available time}
The time available is five mornings in two weeks by five people. That's about twenty hours per person, however, some time should be reserved for the meetings. So the total effort available is about 90 man hours.

A list of tasks, assignments and effort estimations is included in a table.


\paragraph{Presentation}
Results for this iteration will be presented thursday may 4, 12:15 in DW-PC 0.010.
