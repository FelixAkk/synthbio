Business Object Model explanation
The objects of our model are the proteins, the biobricks, the circuits and the Systems Biology Markup Language.
The protein is the smallest building block of the model, with proteins and gates we can form Biobricks. These Biobricks can then be connected to each other to form a circuit. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) can be used to represent and describe these circuits. So from the circuit the resulting SBML can be obtained and vice versa.
