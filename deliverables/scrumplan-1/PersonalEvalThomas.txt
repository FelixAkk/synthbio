//PERSONAL

This iteration has been so-so. My major mistake was too little communication with team members. 
This together with late commits from my side led to late feedback from others. It also turned out I had a different idea on 
how things would be done client-side, so parts of my implementation was useless as well. I also felt as if other people did more, 
which was probably true, so I want to invest more time into this project. I’ve listed a few things I wish to improve.

So a few things I will to improve for next iteration:

1.	More frequent commits on Git.
2.	More communication towards team members.
3.	More time spent coding.
4.	More looking into other people’s code to support them.

There are also a few things I’m really proud of:

1.	Concise commenting
2.	Clean code
3.	Real TDD


//GENERAL

The client-side scaffolding didn't go as smooth. One of the issues we encountered was predefined JSON methods.
We considered this because it would make the code more concise, but to we couldnt override JSOn methods without a nasty workaround.
Eventually we skipped the workaround because the code was not clean and the JSON predefined methods work fine as well.
Another issues was the QUnit testing. Implementing tests works rather well but the feedback once something goes wrong is rather useless often.
So the debugging took more time than expected. The javascript scaffolding was not completed within the scheduled time because of a lack of 
communication on Thomas his side. This has been pointed out and will be improved.
