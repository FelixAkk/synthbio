I think I expected us to take more time for completing the tasks than the estimated time. Mostly because we also had a lot of setup to do and to get things working which we had no experience with. And especially with such situations it's particularly prone to getting stuck on something that you can't get working. Also I think we didn't create the estimates completely accurate because the sum ended up pretty close to the calculated total work hours available. However this last figure turened out to be wrong. In the end I think next time we should stick better to the planning game.
